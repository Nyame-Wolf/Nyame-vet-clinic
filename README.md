## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- The [schema.sql](./schema.sql) has been used to create all tables.
- The [data.sql](./data.sql) has been used to populate tables with sample data.
- The [queries.sql](./queries.sql) has examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
